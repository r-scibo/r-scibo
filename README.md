## 💡 Current Projects
### Robotic Arm Controlled by EEG Signals
The Intelligent Prosthetic Arm project is focused on developing a prosthetic hand controlled through EEG brain signals, combined with advanced computer vision and sensors for safe, real-time object interaction. The system incorporates machine learning, real-time image recognition, object detection, and sensor data to enable the prosthetic arm to mimic natural hand movements, providing a highly functional solution for users to interact with everyday objects, such as water bottles and more.
